**iPhone Sale Notifier** is an unofficial Chrome extension to help you keep track of iPhone stock status and notify you by browser notification when it is available. Right now it only supports the Hong Kong Apple Online Store.

You can install the extension on [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/onggnokegmdgdgipnpbaefmgbhkkhcfa)

## Features
- Keep track of iPhone 8 and iPhone X stock status
- Support Apple Online Store and iReserve for iPhone X
- Notify by browser extension
- Support Traditional Chinese and English

## How to use it?
1. Click the extension icon in your browser's toolbar
2. Click EDIT, choose the iPhone models you want to monitor and save it
3. Don't forget to enable the extension in the main menu
4. Use your browser as usual. The extension will notify you automatically when your selected iPhone model is available.

## How does it works?
It opens a tab in your browser and regularly check for the stock status of the iPhone models you have chosen.

## Library used
This is a project I do on leisure. I have tried to use some of the libraries which are new to me or some that I want to learn more. Here are some of them:

- React.js
- Redux and Redux Saga
- Radium
- i18next
- Mocha, Chai and Sinon
- Webpack, Babel

## Testing

Right now only part of the code are covered by test cases. More thorough tests are wished but is not scheduled.

While it is common to keep test files in a separate `test` folder. I am more used to putting `_test.js` next to the file approach. I think it is more a style preference but I am open to discussion.
