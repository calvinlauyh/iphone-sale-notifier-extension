# iPhone Sale Notifier Extension

**iPhone Sale Notifier Extension** is an Chrome extension to help you keep track of iPhone stock status and notify you by browser notification when it is available. Right now it only supports the Hong Kong Apple Online Store.

You can install the extension on [Chrome web store]()

- Keep track of iPhone 8 and iPhone X sale status
- Support Apple Online Store and iReserve for iPhone X
- Notify by browser extension

## Library used

This is a project I do on leisure. I have tried to use some of the libraries which are new to me or some that I want to learn more. Here are some of them:

- React.js
- Redux and Redux Saga
- Radium
- i18next
- Mocha, Chai and Sinon
- Webpack, Babel

## Testing

Right now only part of the code are covered by test cases. More thorough tests are wished but is not scheduled.

While it is common to keep test files in a separate `test` folder. I am more used to putting `_test.js` next to the file approach. I think it is more a style preference but I am open to discussion.
